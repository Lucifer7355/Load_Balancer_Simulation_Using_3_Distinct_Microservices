# Load_Balancer_Simulation_Using_3_Distinct_Microservices

## Procedure to run the load balancer simulation project :
```
* Run all three microservices built in SpringBoot on distinct ports (you can change port numbers as per requirements if default mentioned ports are occupied).
* Now open testing class in Eclipse or InteliJ Idea and run the code. 
* You can see the weighted load balancer simulation as per the hardcoded Throughputs of each microservices(Servers assumed).
* The Simulation can be tested further by writing different unit tests as per requirements.
```
